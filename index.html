  <p> A BUG in the Capital region of Finland.
  </p>
  <p> Capital of Finland being Helsinki, naturally our BUG is named HELBUG.
  </p>
  <p> HELBUGs goal is to promote the use of the BSD variants and the knowledge relating to this.
  </p>
  <p> Helsinki area BSD User Groups (HELBUGs) plan is to have semiregular meetings with varying agendas. 
  </p>
  <p> These will include talks, seminars, hacking workshops and general discussion on BSD variants.
  </p>
  <p> Next meeting is taking place on Tuesday the 17th of April (2018-04-17) at It√§lahdenkatu 22A,Helsinki at 17:00.</p>
