  </p>
  <p> A BUG in the Capital region of Finland.
  </p>
  <p> Capital of Finland being Helsinki, naturally our BUG is named HELBUG.
  </p>
  <p> HELBUGs goal is to promote the use of the BSD variants and the knowledge relating to this.
  </p>
  <p> Helsinki area BSD User Groups (HELBUGs) plan is to have semiregular meetings with varying agendas. 
  </p>
  <p> These will include talks, seminars, hacking workshops and general discussion on BSD variants.
  </p>
  <p>   </p>
  <p> Next meeting is taking place during the fall of 2018.</p>
  <p> More detailed agenda for our next meeting will be posted later to this website or at the meetup website.</p>
